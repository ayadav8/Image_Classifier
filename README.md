# Image Classifier
Image classifier using PyTorch and pretrained neural networks

Most of us are using image clasification algorithms in our daily activities. Some of the applications include:
1. Photo organization apps in the mobile phones,
2. Stock Photography and Video Websites,
3. Visual search API which helps people to search a similar product using a refernce image they clicked on the phone, and
4. Image recognition on social media

Image classification is the primary domain, in which deep neural networks play the most important role of image analysis. Here the computer is fed some data in form of images, computer tries to understand the relationship between the data and the classes into which they are classified which we call as training process and then use the same understanfing to classify an image which the computer hasn't seen before which we call as testing process or inference.

In this project we will be using a supervised classification algorithm where we define the classes that the data are classified into and provide the training data of each defined class. Here we will be creating a neural network model that can recognize different species of flowers. We have a dataset of 102 flower categories. We will also cover how we can use TorchVision module to load pre-trained models and carry out model inference to classify an image.

In the end of the project, we will have a command line application which can be applied on any user specified train dataset, user sepcified model to carry out inference on user sepcified test dataset.

This is the final Project of the Udacity AI with Python Nanodegree
